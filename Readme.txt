README: GDP Prediction and Analysis
This README provides an overview of the GDP prediction and analysis project, including information about its implementation, processes involved, and principles utilized.

Overview

This Python script is designed to download GDP (Gross Domestic Product) data from the World Bank API, clean and analyze the data, decide the appropriate model type (Regression or Classification), and predict GDP values for future years using the Random Forest Regression model. The script is structured into several functions to perform these tasks sequentially.

The GDP (Gross Domestic Product) prediction and analysis project aim to forecast future GDP values for various countries using historical GDP data. The project involves several steps, including data acquisition, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, machine learning modeling, and visualization.

Implementation
The project is implemented in Python programming language using various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Requests, Openpyxl, and more.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, requests, openpyxl, docx

Process Overview
1. Data Acquisition: Historical GDP data is obtained from the World Bank API using the download_gdp_data function.

2. Data Cleaning: The acquired data is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers using the clean_data_advanced function.

3. Data Analysis and Visualization: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the patterns and distributions in the data. Visualization techniques such as candlestick plots and histograms are used to visualize the data using the analyze_and_visualize function.

4. Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis is conducted to calculate descriptive statistics such as mean, variance, and covariance for the GDP data using the calculate_statistics function.

5. Machine Learning Modeling: Machine learning models, particularly Random Forest Regression, are utilized to predict future GDP values for each country using the random_forest_regression_all_countries function.

6. Documentation: Documentation including this README is created to provide insights into the project's objectives, implementation, and processes involved

Principles

Data Cleaning
Missing values are handled using linear interpolation to fill gaps in the data.
Outliers are detected using Z-score method, and extreme values are replaced with NaN.
Values beyond the 95th percentile are capped to prevent extreme influences on the analysis.

Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics such as mean, variance, and covariance are calculated to summarize the GDP data for each country over the years.

Machine Learning Modeling
Random Forest Regression is chosen as the predictive model due to its ability to handle nonlinear relationships and feature interactions.
Historical GDP values are used as features to predict future GDP values for each country.

How to Use

1. Ensure that all the required libraries are installed. You can install them using pip:
pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn requests openpyxl python-docx

2.Run the Python script main.py.
python main.py

3.The script will execute the following steps:

Download GDP data from the World Bank API.
 
Rearrange and save the data in an Excel file.

Clean the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and removing outliers.

Analyze and visualize the data using line plots, bar plots, and descriptive statistics.


Decide the appropriate model type (Regression or Classification) based on certain criteria.

Predict GDP values for the years 2021 and 2022 using the Random Forest Regression model for all countries.
Save the predicted GDP values in a new sheet in the Excel file.


File Structure
main.py: The main Python script containing all the functions and the main execution flow.
downloaded_data/: Directory to store downloaded and processed data.
README.md: Documentation file providing an overview, instructions, and details about the script.

Additional Notes
Ensure a stable internet connection to download data from the World Bank API.
The script may take some time to execute, especially during data cleaning and model training phases.

Conclusion
The GDP prediction and analysis project offer insights into forecasting future GDP values for different countries. By combining data analysis techniques with machine learning models, the project provides valuable information for economic analysis and decision-making.
